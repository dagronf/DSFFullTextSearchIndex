## Why

I wanted to add a full text search index to my macOS/iOS application and realized that SKSearchKit (and thus [DFSearchKit](https://github.com/dagronf/DFSearchKit) is macOS only. 

SQLite has solid FTS capabilities and I wanted to be able to use these in a similar way as SKSearchKit.  I also wanted a simple wrapper that didn't have any dependencies.  As much as I love [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) I certainly didn't need everything that it provides.

## Simple example

```swift

// Create an index

let index = DSFFullTextSearchIndex()
index.create(filePath: /* some file path */)

//
// Add some documents
//
let url1 = URL(string: "demo://maintext/1")
index.add(url: url1, text: "Sphinx of black quartz judge my vow")

let url2 = URL(string: "demo://maintext/2")
index.add(url: url2, text: "Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")

let url3 = URL(string: "demo://maintext/3")
index.add(url: url3, text: "The dog didn't like the bird sitting on the fence and left quietly")

//
// Search
//
let urls1 = index.search(text: "quartz")   // single match - url1
let urls2 = index.search(text: "quick")    // single match - url2
let urls3 = index.search(text: "dog")      // two matches - url1 and url3

// Search with a wildcard
let urls4 = index.search(text: "qu*")       // three matches = url1 (quartz), url2 (quick) and url3 (quietly)

```
